These are the topics that should be included in our project.

We will maintain a documentaion in which what we are doing is recorded... This also includes scraped off ideas.

1) Web scrapping (To extract information/facts related to our topics)
2) document the process of acquiring the datset
  -> Use oracle to load and merge dataserts (Do this in pandas)
  -> Import that files as dataframes
3) Data Cleaning
  -> mean
  -> KNN
  # Do these 2 and show which is better for analysis.
  -> One hot encoding.
4) A short representation on using feature scaling. (Optional)
5) Analysis on Data:
  -> Matplot
  -> Seaborn
  -> flourish
  -> imap type (if dataset includes locations)
  -> Imp: Find diffrent atributes that are related to each other (Don't miss any possible analysis)
  -> Show comparition in graphs using diffrent tools and show the best tool.
5) Data Wrangling
6) Use of algorithms
  -> Regression
  -> Clustering
  -> Classification
  
  
  This file will be kept updated and is the timeline we would like to follow
