# Military_data_analysis_Project

### This project was created by Apoorv Gupta and Aadith Sukumar. 

#### We as a team of 2 created a project which features:-<br>
⭐ Expenditure Analysis and ML models <br>
⭐ Real Time war Analysis and personals Loss Patterns <br>
⭐ Cyber security threats using Webscraping and NLP <br>

This project focuses on the whole timeline form 1960 - 2022.<br>

#### Part -1 <br>
Militaty expenditure Dataset had data from over 200+ teritories contain its Military bugets throught the year. We analysed its growth and cause as to why does the values lead to a certain amount. The dips and gains in the growths were also analysed by researching on google. We also created a ML model using polynomial regression that predicts future values for all the countries present in dataset, given there is no drastic event that occurs.

#### Part -2<br>
The current Russia-Ukraine war dataset had 2 sections. They are time-series data labeled as Personal losses and Equipment losses. The Datasets were extrated using Kaggle API directly into Jupyter Notebook, this mean whenever the notebook is re-run the datasets are updated to their latest version. The Equipment dataset was all about the materialstic losses such as ships, tanks, missiles, drone etc. Personal losses refers to solders who lost their lives in this unfortunate circumstances. A ML model was created to predict the future losses if the war continues as it is today.

#### Part -3 <br>
The Cyber security aspects as the part of military. The dataset we used contained text data contianing information about the cyber attacks their sources and the victims. We also analysed where were these attacks were happening most among the government and private sectors, what type of attacks where more prominent. The sponsors of attacks were analysed and a pie chart was used to show contribution of each sponsor relative to the rest of the world. We then webscrapped the latest news from the csis orgins on the current war. Later, NLP was used to find the trigger keyword which seprated the news related to the war.
